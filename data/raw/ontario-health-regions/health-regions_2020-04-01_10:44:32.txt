Community transmission means that we expect the number of cases will start to rise over the next days and weeks. Due to this, public health in unable to monitor how the virus is spreading from person to person and this makes it more difficult to slow its spread. This is not just a disease affecting the elderly, most of our cases are among adults between 35 and 64 years of age. This makes it even more important that people protect themselves and others by staying home and assuming that you and everyone around you may be carrying the virus. If we all do this, as well as continue to maintain physical distance of 2 metres from others and wash our hands frequently, we will be putting less people at risk and can flatten the curve. </p> <p><strong>Anyone who has new cold-like/respiratory symptoms (regardless of travel history), and has not been tested for COVID-19, is to self-isolate at home for 14 days.</strong></p> <p> Details on all confirmed cases within Simcoe County and the District of Muskoka are <a href="#Confirmed">listed </a>below. There are also <a href="#Tables">tables </a>of the number of confirmed cases in Simcoe Muskoka, broken down by: age group, status and source of infection.
